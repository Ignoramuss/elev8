- Always add unit tests when you add new code unless it is configuration or other files where unit tests make no sense
- Always create a new feature branch (e.g., `feat/aks-support`) from `main` for every new roadmap item before starting implementation. Never add unrelated roadmap items to an existing feature branch.
